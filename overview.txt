The campaign will take place in Nazzurat, a vast and hostile desert encompassing the majority of Rhega's largest landmass. Expect extreme temperatures, limited resources, and remote settlements. Nazzurat borders Tjotia, Lustrum, and Rigar Daji, with each border defined by a mountain range. East of Nazzurat is Amphina, across treacherous waters. Your character can be from these regions, and more info on them is in the file 02. Locale. 

Your character will have some involvement in the artifact and archaeology trade in Nazzurat. The sands routinely swallow and reveal ruins and caves, offering steady enough income for those willing or interested. Guards, guides, historians, travelers, and power-seekers are common amongst those familiar with the trade. 

As of the start of the campaign, you have been drawn together by a young woman named Zaphine, whether you'd been in the area for days or months, she's taken notice and asked you to meet for a job offer. Direct contact like this is uncommon, though the mention of needing to work with a larger group is rarer still. All you know is she asked for discretion and promised good pay
