The world of Rhega lies upon the corpse of an ancient dragon. His flesh, blood, and bones became land, seas, and mountains. His final breaths bore the first breaths of dragons lesser only to himself. 

For a time there was naught but dragons reigning Rhega, so when men emerged from its depths, they fell quickly under dragon dominion. For countless generations, men lived in servitude until whispers of rebellion stirred. In secret, men organized and sought a path to freedom, venturing far to seek power to free themselves. Only seven of those who left returned to the others alive, transformed by what they found. These seven had become gods, and began reshaping men into forms capable of resisting their draconic overlords.

After centuries of war, men freed themselves from dragon rule, but the victory carried a cost. Men were now divided, each marked by the will of the gods, who had then become their own threat; their minds deteriorating as their divine power grew. One by one, they vanished, leaving only mystery and legend behind.

Now, the world stands fractured; the bonds of men have been sundered, the lands as scarred as those who walk them, and the threat of dragons lingers as societies weaken.
